# Number Guessing Game

Created own Number guessing game using C language.

The user has to guess a number, and if their guess is correct, the output will show the attempt number at which they were correct and the total number of attempts they made.<br>

I used loops and the rand() function in C to create this game, and I added the stdlib.h and time.h libraries to remove errors from the program.<br>
